## Project Vision

GitScribe is a modern Windows Git client that combines the contextual convenience of TortoiseGit with contemporary performance, reliability, and user experience. It provides seamless Windows Explorer integration while addressing the performance issues, crashes, and limitations that plague existing shell-integrated Git tools.

## Core Philosophy

- **Performance First**: Every operation should be fast and non-blocking
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple tasks simple, complex tasks possible
- **Reliability**: No crashes, no frozen dialogs, no silent failures
- **Visual Clarity**: See repository state at a glance without cognitive overload
- **Extensibility**: Let users and enterprises customize their workflows

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- Windows developers who prefer GUI tools over command line
- Teams transitioning from SVN/TFS to Git
- Developers who use TortoiseGit but are frustrated with its limitations
- Enterprise development teams needing standardized Git workflows

### Secondary Users
- Git beginners who need a gentler learning curve
- Developers who occasionally need visual tools for complex operations
- Teams managing multiple related repositories

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

**Core Library (gitscribe-core)**
- Language: Rust
- Git Implementation: libgit2 with custom optimizations
- Features: Async operations, caching layer, partial clone support
- Exposed as: C API for shell extension, Node native module for Electron

**Shell Extension (gitscribe-shell)**
- Language: C++
- Framework: Windows COM/Shell Extensions
- Features: Context menus, overlay icons, property sheets
- Cache: SQLite for icon overlay cache, filesystem watchers for invalidation
- **Lightweight Mode**: Overlay icons only (no context menus, no app dependency)

**Application (gitscribe-app)**
- Framework: Electron with Rust native modules (or Tauri)
- UI Framework: React with TypeScript
- State Management: Redux Toolkit with persistence
- IPC: Named pipes for shell-to-app communication
- **Optional**: Not required for lightweight overlay-only installation

**Plugin System**
- Runtime: QuickJS or WASM sandbox
- API: TypeScript definitions
- Distribution: npm-compatible package format

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Separate shell extension from application** - Shell extension stays minimal for stability
2. **Rust core for memory safety** - Prevent crashes that plague TortoiseGit
3. **SQLite for local caching** - Fast icon overlays without constant disk access
4. **Message queue for operations** - Prevent "repository is locked" errors
5. **Native credential storage** - Use Windows Credential Manager properly

## Competitive Analysis

### Versus TortoiseGit
**Advantages:**

- No shell crashes
- Modern UI
- Better conflict resolution
- Multi-repo support

**Disadvantages:**
- Less mature
- Smaller community initially
- Fewer integrated features at launch

### Versus SourceTree/GitKraken
**Advantages:**
- Native shell integration
- Faster performance
- Lower memory usage
- No account required
- Better Windows integration

**Disadvantages:**
- Windows-only
- Less visual polish initially
- Fewer collaboration features

## Product Tiers

### GitScribe Status (Available Now - Free Forever)
**Just overlay icons - completely free**
- Icon overlays showing Git status (modified, added, deleted, ignored, clean)
- Fast, cached status updates
- No dialogs, no context menus, no app
- Perfect for users who just want visual indicators
- 2MB installer, minimal resource usage
- **Strategy**: Gateway product, conversion path to full version

### GitScribe Full (Coming Soon)
**Full featured Git client**
- Everything in Status, plus:
- Context menu operations
- Full Electron app with commit/push/pull dialogs
- Advanced Git operations UI
- Repository management features
- **Free for personal use** with optional Pro/Enterprise tiers for teams

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Shell extension stability**: Extensive testing, gradual rollout, fallback mode
- **Performance at scale**: Profiling with large repos, lazy loading, virtual scrolling
- **Git compatibility**: Comprehensive test suite, multiple Git version testing

### Market Risks
- **Low adoption**: Free tier, strong documentation, migration tools from TortoiseGit
- **Enterprise hesitancy**: Security audits, compliance certifications, reference customers

### Resource Risks
- **Development complexity**: Start with MVP, iterate based on feedback
- **Maintenance burden**: Automated testing, clear architecture boundaries

## Development Principles

1. **Lite First**: Build the minimal viable product, validate, then expand
2. **User-Centric Design**: Every feature should solve a real user pain point
3. **Performance Budget**: No operation should block UI for >100ms
4. **Fail Gracefully**: Every error should have a clear message and recovery path
5. **Extensible by Design**: Consider plugin capabilities from day one
6. **Security First**: Credentials encrypted, operations sandboxed, updates signed

## Development Strategy: Status-First Approach

### Why Status First?

1. **Validate core technology**: Prove overlay icons + caching works before building UI
2. **Fast to market**: Get something useful in users' hands in weeks, not months
3. **Lower risk**: Minimal code = fewer bugs, easier testing
4. **Real feedback**: Learn what users actually need before building full app
5. **Incremental funding**: Status can generate interest/users while building full version
6. **Technical foundation**: Shell extension is hardest part - nail it first

## Open Questions

1. Should we support macOS/Linux in the future, or remain Windows-focused?
2. Should plugins have access to shell extension features, or app-only?
3. How much Git education should be built into the UI?
4. Should we build our own merge tool or integrate existing ones?
5. What level of Git internals should we expose to power users?
