## Why MIT License for the Plugin SDK?

We chose the MIT License for the plugin SDK to:

1. **Encourage ecosystem growth**: No restrictions on commercial or non-commercial use
2. **Lower barrier to entry**: Developers don't need to worry about license compliance
3. **Allow proprietary plugins**: Developers can create closed-source plugins
4. **Build trust**: Permissive licensing shows commitment to the community
5. **Maximize adoption**: MIT is widely understood and accepted

## What This Means for Plugin Developers

### ‚úÖ You CAN:

- Use this SDK to create free plugins
- Use this SDK to create paid/commercial plugins
- Modify the SDK for your needs
- Redistribute the SDK
- Keep your plugin source code private
- Sell plugins without any revenue sharing*
- Create competing plugin ecosystems

*Note: The GitScribe plugin registry may take a commission on paid plugins sold through the marketplace. Direct sales are unrestricted.

### üìù You MUST:

- Include the MIT license text in substantial portions of the SDK code
- Include the copyright notice

### ‚ùå You DON'T HAVE TO:

- Open source your plugins
- Share modifications to the SDK
- Pay licensing fees
- Attribute GitScribe in your plugin (though appreciated!)

## Plugins vs. Core Application

**Important**: While the plugin SDK is MIT licensed, the core GitScribe application (gitscribe-app, gitscribe-shell) is proprietary. This SDK license only covers:

- Plugin API definitions (`@gitscribe/plugin-api`)
- Plugin CLI tools (`@gitscribe/plugin-cli`)
- Plugin development utilities (`@gitscribe/plugin-dev`)
- Plugin examples and templates
- Plugin documentation

It does NOT cover:
- GitScribe application binaries
- GitScribe core library (MPL-2.0)
- GitScribe shell extension (Proprietary)
- GitScribe branding and trademarks

## Third-Party Licenses

This SDK may include third-party dependencies under their own licenses. See individual package.json files for details.

## Contributing

By contributing to this SDK, you agree to license your contributions under the MIT License.
